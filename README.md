# simple-hash-checker
This is a simple string comparator that can be used to check hashes, but it can compare any type of text, it is my first ever python code.

The script just compares the first string with another string you add, it isnt much, but i plan to add some more things in the future, but for now, those 15 lines of code are all
there is for now

(Sorry for bad english, it isnt my first language)
